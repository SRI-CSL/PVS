;;; The entry point is compare, which compares two theories and returns two
;;; values: an indication of whether they compare and an association list
;;; which indicates the differences found.  The possible association list
;;; entries are:
;;;    (oexporting nexporting difference)
;;;    (ousing nusing difference)
;;;    (oconstructor nconstructor difference)
;;;    (odecl ndecl difference)
;;; where
;;;   difference - added, deleted, reordered, changed, signature, body

;;; compare compares two theories, generally calling compare-decl-lists on the
;;; formals, etc.
