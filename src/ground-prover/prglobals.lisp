; global variables and declarations for the prover subsystem
;
; -- Allen Van Gelder, Sep 4, 1984.
;
; 10-Oct-85  FvH - macros have been moved to file prmacros
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
; global variables/constants with initializations
;
; CONVENTION:
; Use "defconst" for something that should "never" change.
; Use "defvar" with an initialization (2nd) argument for something that
;     does not change during the course of execution, but may evolve over
;     time.  Initialization to nil may be a placeholder to allow the
;     third (documentation) argument to be specified.
; Use "defvar" with an initialization (2nd) argument for symbols that may
;     be changed by the user to control execution, but are not changed
;     by normal program execution.  Flags, switches, etc. are in this
;     category.
; Use "setq" in an initialization function to initialize things that
;     are expected to vary during execution.  This allows the execution to
;     be completely re-initialized, which is desirable in itself for
;     debugging, and also serves as valuable documentation.
