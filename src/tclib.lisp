;;; There are thus three kinds of library references:

;;;      Two different librefs may point to the same library.
;;;      If the libref is a simple name, e.g., "foo", then the reference
;;;      may be ambiguous; there are three possibilities:
;;;      a. There is a visible library declaration in the current context
;;;         of the form foo: LIBRARY = ...
;;;      b. There is a foo subdirectory of the current directory
;;;      c. There is a <PVS_LIBRARY_PATH>/foo directory.
;;;      Note that if the string ends in "/", then a. is not possible.
;;;      If the name starts with ".", "..", or "/" then it is a
;;;      relative or absolute pathname, and there is no ambiguity.

;;;      We return a canonical libkey; in case a. we use the canonical
;;;      lib-ref given in the library declaration, b. uses "./foo/", and
;;;      c. uses "foo/".

;;;   2. A libkey, which is a string that is the canonical libref
;;;      This is used to look up the library in hash tables, and to
;;;      store information in the .pvscontext and .bin files.
;;;      a. If the libref is to <PVS_LIBRARY_PATH>/foo, then this is "foo/"
;;;      b. This is a relative pathname if the directory is  a subdirectory
;;;         of the directory two levels above the current directory.
;;;         In this case the string always starts with "./" or "../"
;;;      c. It is a users home directory, in which case it starts with
;;;         "~/" or "~username/", depending on whether it is the current
;;;         users home directory.
;;;      d. Otherwise, it is an absolute pathname, starting with "/".

;;;   3. A libpath, which is an absolute pathname.

lib-path may be returned with a null lib-id.  The lib-ref is a symbol,
string, or pathname; typically the library id from an importing name, or the
string from the change-context command.

It first checks whether the libref is an existing directory.  If it is, then
it may be absolute or relative to the current workspace.  In addition, it
could be a valid library id, though it may have a '/' at the end when
associated with the PVS_LIBRARY_PATH (older .pvscontext files do this).  If
the libref has '/'s other than at the end, the last subdir is checked for
valid PVS id.

the PVS_LIBRARY_PATH.
