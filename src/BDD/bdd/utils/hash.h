/* Include file for hashtable module. */

/* Here a hashtable is implemented as a C struct with a dynamically
   allocated array of entries. In fact, the entries array is an array
   of pointers to the real entries. A real entry again is a struct with
   3 fields: the key string which is a character pointer, the length of
   the key string and a general purpose void pointer info field.
   The key string and key length data are used by some of the hashtable
   routines; the info field's meaning is entirely the user's responsibility.
   In most cases it will be the hook to user defined data associated with
   this hashtable entry.

   When using shadowing the hash table will always be accessed through an
   additional indirection table which allows for smooth rehashing such that
   for the application this rehashing is transparant.
*/
   
/* Define this to allow rehashing upon table full, else an error
   message is printed on stderr and the program is aborted.
   Default table size is 11 entries, and is about doubled on each rehash.
   See the struct HASHTAB for info on keeping track of repositioned entries.
*/
#define ALLOW_REHASH

/* Define this to allow for automatic use of a shadow table of indices.
   This shadow table indirects lookups by always going through it to the
   real hash table.
   This is subordinate to ALLOW_REHASH, i.e. to be effective ALLOW_REHASH
   must also be defined. Upon rehash the shadow table will be properly extended
   and updated. The start of the new area will be marked by shadow_free_index.

   `do_insert' can be one of the constants LOOKUP or INSERT, or the
   address of an int variable containing one of those constants.
   LOOKUP means: just see if `s' is already present.
   INSERT means: insert the string when not already present.
                 String is copied in this case and a null terminator character
                 is always added (and room allocated for).
   In case `do_insert' holds the address of an int variable, ALREADY_PRESENT
   or INDEED_INSERTED is reported back through it.

   When a new item is inserted it is associated with the `info', which
   must be the address of a character pointer variable upon entry, or NULL
   if info is of no concern.
   When an item is retrieved, i.e. it was already present, its info is returned
   through `info'.

   Uses quadratic probing to resolve collisions. Unfortunately this might lead
   to a situation where the free entries are present but cannot be found by
   this probing scheme.
