RAHD: Real Algebra in High Dimensions
 v0.5
  written by Grant Olney Passmore

                   ~ 25-November-2009


[Installation]
 RAHD is distributed with both an x86 linux binary,
  and its ANSI Common Lisp source code.


 To run RAHD without building, you may execute
  `./rahd-v0.5-lx32.'


 To build RAHD v0.5, please do the following:

   (i) obtain SBCL (`Steel Bank Common Lisp'),
  (ii) modify `maker' to point to your SBCL binary,
 (iii) run `./maker' to compile RAHD.
  (iv) run `./rahd-v0.5-lx32.' 




[Running RAHD]
 This version of RAHD has only a very primitive
  input language.  To run RAHD upon an implicitly
  existentially quantified formula, you must
  provide the formula in LISP S-expression 
  conjunctive normal form as a command-line 
  argument to RAHD.  Most shells will require
  this argument be placed in double-quotes.

 The formula must be preceded by the argument
  `-formula.'  This tells the Lisp kernel to
  hand the command line over to RAHD.

 If you run RAHD without any arguments, a list
  of possible command-line options will be 
  displayed.

 Example:

    ./rahd-v0.5-lx32 -formula "(((NOT (> (+ (* A D) (+ (* C B) (* B D))) 0)))
                                ((>= B 0))
                                ((>= C 0))
                                ((>= D 1))
                                ((>= (+ (* A A) (- (* A B) (* B B))) 1))
                                ((>= (+ (* 2 A) B) 1))
                                ((<= (+ (* C C) (+ (- (* C D) (* D D)) 1))
                                  0)))"


    * A few more examples can be found in the file `EXAMPLES.'
   



[Caveats]

 This version of RAHD is very preliminary, and is
  missing many important features whose production-
  worthy implementations are nearing completion.
 
 Future versions will be much more powerful! ;-)
