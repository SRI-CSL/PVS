;;; SPLIT-TM-FOR-CASE: Given a case and optionally a term, return c together
;;;  with a generator for a waterfall split on ((= tm 0) (< tm 0) (> tm)).
;;;
;;; If tm is not given, then the first var appearing in c will be selected.
;;;
;;; We now accept an optional pt (point) argument.  If pt is given, then
;;;  the interval for term tm will be split at pt.
