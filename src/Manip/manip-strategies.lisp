;; This file implements various PVS strategies (tactics) for manipulating
;; arithmetic expressions and performing other detailed proving.  It
;; includes strategies helpful for proving formulas containing nonlinear
;; arithmetic and similar expressions where PVS has limited automation.
;; Some strategies allow ordinary algebraic manipulation while others
;; are focused on more specialized reasoning for product terms.  Also
;; included are some more general strategies to manipulate sequents, such
;; as higher-order operations that accept parameterized commands and
;; perform substitutions to arrive at concrete command instances.
;;
;; A second feature set implements an extended method of specifying input
;; expressions when invoking prover commands.  Two major types of extensions
;; are included: location references and textual pattern matching.  Location
;; references allow a user to indicate a precise subexpression within a
;; formula by giving a path of indices to follow when descending through the
;; formula's expression tree.  Pattern matching allows strings to be found
;; and extracted using a specialized pattern language that is based on, but
;; much less elaborate than, regular expressions.
;;
;; A new type of search was introduced in version 1.2 that allows users
;; to match against syntax elements of PVS expressions.  Match results
;; can be used to display information about the sequent or invoke proof
;; rule templates after substituting matched text.
;;
;; A method based on object orientation was introduced in version 1.3 to
;; allow manipulation of expressions for non-real types such as vectors.
;; Extensions were introduced here along with a corresponding set of
;; functions in the file manip-vectors.lisp, which resides in the NASA
;; PVS library called vectors.  Similar extensions for other types can
;; make use of this same machinery.
;;
;; This version of the Manip package has been tested on PVS versions 4.2
;; and 5.0.  It should work with PVS 4.0 or 4.1, although it is not
;; recommended for any earlier versions of PVS.

;;; ==================== Library Extension Framework =====================

;; Some of the Manip strategies have been generalized to allow their use
;; with types other than real.  Those types that support overloading of
;; the arithmetic operators can be used in certain manipulations as long
;; as strategy extensions are provided in the relevant libraries.  These
;; extensions take the form of Lisp code residing in the library's
;; directory.  A file named "pvs-strategies" in this directory will be
;; loaded when the first relevant proof is invoked, which in turn will
;; load additional Lisp files as needed.
;;
;; CLOS classes are used to dispatch methods according to operand types.
;; The methods for reals are built in to this manip-strategies file.
;; Those for library-specific types such as vectors are declared within
;; Lisp files in the library's directory.  These files will register the
;; library extensions available to Manip users.  This happens when the
;; extension files are loaded, which occurs when the first proof using
;; the library is started.

include 'rep' (replace first matched instance with template), 'case' (use
case splitting on expressions), a binary relation symbol (split on case
