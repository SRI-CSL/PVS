(in-package :pvs)

;;; This package provides functions for efficiently storing Lisp
;;; objects in a file.  It correctly handles circularity and sharing.
;;; It also provides a CLOS protocol with which users of the package
;;; can specify and modify its behavior.  It uses highly efficient I/O
;;; and does very little consing.

;;; The main entry points are store-object-to-file and
;;; fetch-object-from-file.  The function store-object-to-file takes
;;; an object and a filename, and stores the object in that file; the
;;; function fetch-object-from-file takes a filename and returns the
;;; object which was stored in that file.

;;; Currently, the following types are supported by store-object:
;;; cons, hash-table, integer, package, string, symbol.  The methods
;;; for package and symbol assume that the package structure will be
;;; the same on reading and writing, and that the current package uses
;;; the common-lisp package.

;;; To add new supported types (or modify the behavior on existing
;;; types), you can add methods on store-object*.  The existing
;;; methods may be overridden (except for the method for symbols).

;;; A store-object* method takes an object and decides how many words
;;; of storage it will take to store it (where a word is an
;;; (unsigned-byte 32).  It then calls the macro reserve-space, giving
;;; it the number of words of storage required and a body which
;;; actually stores the object by calling push-word for every word.
;;; Within the body of a reserve-space macro, the function store-obj
;;; can be called, which takes an object and returns a word
;;; identifying that object.  Strings can be stored with push-string;
;;; (push-string-length str) words of storage must be reserved.

;;; The first word stored by a store-object* method must be returned
;;; by store-obj on a symbol, where that symbol will be used to
;;; determine how to reconstruct the object.

;;; To handle circularity, object reconstruction takes place in two
;;; stages.  In the first stage, the object is created; in the second
;;; stage, the object is modified to correctly point to other objects.
;;; (Objects like symbols, integers, and strings, which cannot contain
;;; arbitrary other objects, are reconstructed in one step.)

;;; To handle the first stage, object creation, the type identifier
;;; (the symbol which was the first word pushed by the corresponding
;;; store-object*) is looked up, and a (get type-identifier 'fetcher)
;;; is done.  If this exists, it must be a function of no arguments
;;; which returns an object which will be eql to the final desired
;;; object.  It can do this by returning an already-existing object
;;; (symbols and packages do this), by creating the exact desired
;;; final object (integers do this), or by creating an object which
;;; will be updated later to contain the correct other objects
;;; ("structured" objects, which may contain other objects, must do
;;; this, unless you know that there are no circularities involved).

;;; In the second stage, object updating, the objects which were
;;; registered during the first stage as needing to be updated are
;;; updated by calling (update-fetched object) on each one.

;;; The fetcher and the update-fetched method may use the stored-word
;;; macro to find the nth word pushed by store-object* and the
;;; fetch-obj function to find the object corresponding to a given
;;; word.  (Don't call fetch-obj from the fetcher unless you know how
;;; this system works and you've thought about circularities.)  The
;;; fetcher may also call register-for-updating if update-fetched
;;; needs to be called on this object.  Strings that were stored with
;;; push-string may be retrieved with fetch-temp-string, which takes
;;; one argument and returns a temporary string (it might be modified
;;; by further calls to fetch-temp-string).

;;; There's a special case for CLOS objects: if there is no fetcher
;;; for a type identifier, then the object is created using something
;;; equivalent to (make-instance type-identifier), and it is
;;; registered for updating.  This will be more efficient if you
;;; execute the macro register-make-instance on the type identifier.

;; This hash table is never deleted, only cleared; so it grows to the
;; right size and stays there.
