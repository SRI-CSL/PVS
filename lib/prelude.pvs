% The PVS prelude.

% The prelude consists of theories that are built in to the PVS system.
% It is typechecked the same as any other PVS theory, but there are hooks
% in the typechecker that require most of these theories to be available,
% hence the order of the theories is important.  For example, no formulas
% may be declared before the booleans are available, as the formula is
% expected to have type bool.  Since definitions implicitly involve both
% formulas and equality, the booleans theory may not include any
% definitions.  Formulas are given below as AXIOMs, POSTULATEs, and LEMMAs.
% POSTULATEs are formulas that can be proved using the decision procedures,
% but would have to be given as axioms in a pure development of the theory.
% AXIOMs are formulas that cannot be proved, and LEMMAS are formulas that
% have been proved.

% booleans declares the type boolean and its abbreviation bool, along
% with the boolean constants true and false and the boolean connectives.
% The properties of the connectives are given later, but the connectives
% are built in to the typechecker so must be provided early on.
% Note: the boolean type could be defined as the enumeration type {false,
% true}, but booleans are primitive; the correct handling of enumeration
% types requires the boolean type.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%  An alternate formulation of function inverses.  The version above
%  requires that the domain type be nonempty.  This causes two
%  difficulties:
%
%  (1) Functions from empty types to empty types have inverses, but the
%      function_inverse theory cannot describe them.
%
%  (2) Bijections always have inverses, but function_inverse (uselessly)
%      generates TCCs requiring that the domain type be nonempty.
%
%  Furthermore, for non-injective functions, the function_inverse theory
%  only gives a way of generating *some* inverse, using the Axiom of Choice.
%  There is no way to ask whether some function *is* an inverse of the given
%  function.
%
%  This theory is presented in two parts.  The first part makes no
%  assumptions about the domain and range types at all.  It presents
%  basic definitions, and some results that can be proven with no
%  information on the types.  The second part uses an assumption on the
%  input types, which is constructed to be as easily satisfiable as
%  possible.  However, this is still not as convenient as the
%  function_inverse version when the domain type is known to be nonempty.

% exponentiation provides the definitions expt and ^.  expt multiplies a
% real by itself the number of times specified, where 0 times returns a 1
% (thus expt(0,0) = 1).  ^ is defined in terms of expt to work for
% integers, but in this case if the integer negative then the real
% argument must be nonzero; this leads to the dependent type given below.

% strings - the strings theory introduces the char type and represents
% strings as a finite sequence of chars.  The lemmas are useful for
% rewriting.  This theory is useful to auto-rewrite with, but make sure
% that list2finseq is not also an auto-rewrite rule.
%
% strings are input as a sequence of characters between double
% quotes.  The \ is an escape character, whose value depends on the
% following character(s).  \" and \\ are used to embed a " and \ in a string.
% A \0 followed by an octal number (< 0400), a \ followed by 
% a decimal number (< 256) or a \x or \X followed by a
% hexidecimal number (< FF) represents that character number. 
% Decimal numbers must be written without leading zeros, as 
% otherwise they will get interpreted as octal (for instance 
% "\065" = "\53" = "\x35"). If the character following such an escape 
% is a digit one has to use the maximal number of digits in the escape 
% (for instance "\00530" = "50" while "\0530" is illegal). Therefore, 
% if one wants to put escape (\27) followed by a 0 into a string one 
% has to use two escapes ("\27\30") or an octal or hex escape 
% ("\00330" = "\x1b0") because \270 is illegal (270 > 255) and 
% \027 is interpreted as octal.
% The other possibilities are:
%  \a  - 007 (C-g, Bell)
%  \b  - 008 (C-h, Backspace)
%  \t  - 009 (C-i, Tab)
%  \n  - 010 (C-j, Newline)
