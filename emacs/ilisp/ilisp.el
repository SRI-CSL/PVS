;;; This file defines a generic LISP interface that can be customized
;;; to match a specific LISP dialect.  Support is already provided for
;;; a number of common LISP dialects.  Lucid, Allegro and CMU are
;;; fully supported.  Other LISP dialects are missing features like
;;; arglist and find-source.

;;; Since this is built on top of the general command-interpreter-in-
;;; a-buffer mode (comint mode), it shares a common base
;;; functionality, and a common set of bindings, with all modes
;;; derived from comint mode.  This makes it easier to use.

;;; For documentation on the functionality provided by comint mode,
;;; and the hooks available for customizing it, see the file
;;; comint.el.

;;; Throughout this file you will find comment lines with %'s on them.
;;; These lines define sections for outline mode which I use while
;;; programming to temporarily hide code.

;;; See the documentation for ILISP mode, or read texinfo document for
;;; information.  All of the EMACS function names begin or end with
;;; lisp or ilisp to separate ilisp functions from functions in other
;;; packages.  Functions that work only in lisp buffers or that work
;;; in both lisp buffers and inferior lisp buffers use lisp, all other
;;; functions use ilisp.  If a function is intended to be used
;;; interactively, then the lisp or ilisp comes at the end of the
;;; function name, otherwise at the start.

;;;%%KNOWN BUGS
;;; 
;;; If you type multiple things to the top level before you get a
;;; prompt, the LISP may be running with the status light indicating
;;; ready.  This is because I have no way to distinguish between input
;;; to a program and that to the top level.
;;;
;;; When running a lisp on Ultrix, you need to set ilisp-program to
;;; "/bin/sh -c your/path/your-lisp-image".
;;; 
;;; If you get lisp output breaking up in weird places it almost
;;; certainly means that comint-prompt-regexp is not precise enough.
;;;
;;; I would like to eat Lucid's return from break in the process
;;; filter, but I can't tell how many newlines to eat after.
