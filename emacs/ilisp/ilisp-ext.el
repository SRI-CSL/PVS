;;; When loaded this file adds new functionality to emacs lisp mode
;;; and lisp mode. 
;;; 
;;; Default bindings:
;;;
;;; M-x find-unbalanced-lisp find unbalanced parens in the current
;;; buffer.  With a prefix in the current region. 
;;;
;;; ] Close all open parentheses back to the start of the containing
;;; sexp, or to a previous left bracket which will be converted to a
;;; left paren.
;;;
;;; M-q Reindent comments or strings in paragraph chunks or reindent
;;; the containing sexp.
;;;
;;; M-x comment-region-lisp inserts prefix copies of the comment-start
;;; character before lines in the region and the comment-end character
;;; at the end of each line.  If called with a negative prefix, that
;;; many copies are removed.
;;;
;;; C-M-r repositions the first line of the current defun to the top
;;; of the current window.
;;;
;;; C-M-l switches the current window to the previously seen buffer.
;;;
;;; EXAMPLE .emacs:
;;;
;;; (setq ilisp-ext-load-hook 
;;;   '(lambda () (define-key global-map "\C-\M-l" 'previous-buffer-lisp)))
;;; (require 'ilisp-ext)

;;;%Syntax
;;; This makes it so that .'s are treated as normal characters so that
;;; 3.141 gets treated as a single lisp token.  This does cause dotted
