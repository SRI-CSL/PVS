;;; When loaded, this file extends the standard completion mechanisms
;;; so that they perform pattern matching completions.  There is also
;;; an interface that allows it to be used by other programs.  The
;;; completion rules are:
;;;
;;; 1) If what has been typed matches any possibility, do normal
;;; completion. 
;;;
;;; 2) Otherwise, generate a regular expression such that
;;; completer-words delimit words and generate all possible matches.
;;; The variable completer-any-delimiter can be set to a character
;;; that matches any delimiter.  If it were " ", then "by  d" would be 
;;; byte-recompile-directory.  If completer-use-words is T, a match is
;;; unique if it is the only one with the same number of words.  If
;;; completer-use-words is NIL, a match is unique if it is the only
;;; possibility.  If you ask the completer to use its best guess, it
;;; will be the shortest match of the possibilities unless
;;; completer-exact is T.
;;;
;;; 3) For filenames, if completer-complete-filenames is T, each
;;; pathname component will be individually completed, otherwise only
;;; the final component will be completed.  If you are using a
;;; distributed file system like afs, you may want to set up a
;;; symbolic link in your home directory or add pathname components to
;;; completer-file-skip so that the pathname components that go across
;;; machines do not get expanded.
;;;
;;; SPACE, TAB, LFD, RET, and ? do normal completion if possible
;;; otherwise they do partial completion.  In addition, C-DEL will
;;; undo the last partial expansion or contraction.  M-RET will always
;;; complete to the current match before returning.  This is useful
;;; when any string is possible, but you want to complete to a string
;;; as when calling find-file.  The bindings can be changed by using
;;; completer-load-hook.
;;;
;;; Modes that use comint-dynamic-complete (like cmushell and ilisp)
;;; will also do partial completion as will M-tab in Emacs LISP.
;;;
;;; Examples:
;;; a-f     auto-fill-mode
;;; b--d    *beginning-of-defun or byte-recompile-directory
;;; by  d   *byte-recompile-directory if completer-any-delimiter is " "
;;; ~/i.e   *~/ilisp.el or ~/il-el.el or ~/ilisp.elc
;;; /u/mi/  /usr/misc/
