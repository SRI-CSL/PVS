;;; Commentary:

;; This file and it's extensions have been named ilisp-xemacs-menu before. 
;; As it is ensured now to work with any Emacs with easymenu the file
;; itself and all relevant names (of commands and variables) are renamed. 

;; Use this file as an extension to Ilisp 5.7/5.8 
;; (seee http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~campbell/ilisp/index.html)
;; Put it in a place where (X)Emacs can find it and augment your
;; .emacs like the following to use it.
;; (load-library "ilisp-easy-menu")
;; This needs to be loaded prior to Ilisp !
;; This should give you the menu in any source code buffer and any inferior 
;; ilisp buffer. Be careful: the menu is initialized with add-hook
;; on ilisp-mode-hook and lisp-mode-hook, so if you setq these two
;; hooks afterwards you won't get the menu.
;;
;; If you want to use it with Emacs (not XEmacs) you will want to get rid
;; of the old menu. You can do so by applying the following patches (to
;; Ilisp 5.8 - for 5.7 check for ilisp-update-menu and the loading of the
;; menu, i.e. ilisp-menu and ilisp-mnb)
;; For ilisp.el:
;; 185c185,187
