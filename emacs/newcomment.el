;;; Commentary:

;; A replacement for simple.el's comment-related functions.

;;; Bugs:

;; - single-char nestable comment-start can only do the "\\s<+" stuff
;;   if the corresponding closing marker happens to be right.
;; - comment-box in TeXinfo generate bogus comments @ccccc@
;; - uncomment-region with a numeric argument can render multichar
;;   comment markers invalid.
;; - comment-indent or comment-region when called inside a comment
;;   will happily break the surrounding comment.
;; - comment-quote-nested will not (un)quote properly all nested comment
;;   markers if there are more than just comment-start and comment-end.
;;   For example, in Pascal where {...*) and (*...} are possible.

;;; Todo:

;; - quantized steps in comment-alignment
;; - try to align tail comments
;; - check what c-comment-line-break-function has to say
;; - spill auto-fill of comments onto the end of the next line
;; - uncomment-region with a consp (for blocks) or somehow make the
;;   deletion of continuation markers less dangerous
;; - drop block-comment-<foo> unless it's really used
;; - uncomment-region on a subpart of a comment
;; - support gnu-style "multi-line with space in continue"
;; - somehow allow comment-dwim to use the region even if transient-mark-mode
;;   is not turned on.

;; - when auto-filling a comment, try to move the comment to the left
;;   rather than break it (if possible).
;; - sometimes default the comment-column to the same
;;   one used on the preceding line(s).
