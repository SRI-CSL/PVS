;;;   You can now define your own printing function.  Just define a function 
;;;   called "term:print-term-hook" (taking term,stream,depth as usual).  It
;;;   may decide call the standard function "term:standard-print-term" to do
;;;   the work, e.g. if the term is not in your language, or if *print-escape*
;;;   is on and you don't want to override it.

;;;   Deleted code for primitives: mk-term, term-op, term-args, term-attr,
;;;   set-term-attr and put them in old-term-prims.lisp.  These have been
;;;   replaced by gterm.
