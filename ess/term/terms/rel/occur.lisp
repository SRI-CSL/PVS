;;; The representation --

;;; Occurrences are represented as a single tree with the unique empty
;;; occurrence at the root.  Equal occurrences are consed once and then
;;; inserted into the initial occurrence tree.  Later calls which would
;;; construct equal occurrences merely reference the values already existing in
;;; the tree.  This tree will grow to accomodate arbitrarily deep occurrences.

;;; The rationale -- 

;;; Term traversal's will require building occurrences (Term routines like
;;; get-subterm and replace-subterm require them.).  We would rather not cons
;;; these structures everytime as they are identical.  Instead by paying a
;;; small amount of overhead for initial accesses, we should gain overall
;;; performance.  Further, this single occurrence tree allows us fast
;;; occurrence comparisons (eq) and gives us a place to store the reversed
;;; occurrence (the path from root to term).  The last point is important in
;;; that we really want two forms of the occurrence: 
;;;	1. You want to add a son to a parent occurrence (stored son to root).
;;;	2. You want to get a path from root to subterm (stored root to son).
;;; Achieving these two goals without frequently reversing and appending lists
;;; requires keeping both forward and reversed occurrences. 

;;; Occurrences are given a sexp printed representation.  Lists prefixed with
;;; #q (for path) are occurrences.  They are always printed in descending order
;;; (that is from root to subterm).
