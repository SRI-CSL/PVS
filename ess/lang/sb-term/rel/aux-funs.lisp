; Dependency Graph Stuff
;
;   During look-ahead set generation we need a graph that represents
;   the dependencies between the nonterminals.  For our purposes a nonterminal A
;   is dependent on a nonterminal B if B is a leading symbols in one of
;   A's productions.  (for example, A ::= B ...). 

;   The graph structure is a list containing one element which is a list
;   of the form (NT-name . NT-name) where the leading nonterminal is the node
;   and the list of nt-names is the list of nonterminals that the current node
;   depends on.  So for our example above the graph would look like --
;
;                      ( ( (A B) ) ).
;
;   vertices have the form (nonterminal <name>) or (ext-nonterminal <name>).
;   all the code had to be changed to incorporate this.
