;;; Understanding of the internal grammar term structure is essential to
;;; understanding this code (see documentation in access.lisp). @@@

;;; @@@ Document use of set-pattern-augment, get-pattern-augment.

;;;   The intermediate pass performs several functions on a nonterminal's
;;; pattern and its associated abstract syntax constructors: 
;;;
;;; PASS I -- BIND-AUGMENT's:
;;;         The abstract syntax contructors (augment's) are implicitly bound 
;;;     to the patterns at which they are defined.  This bind is made 
;;;     explicit to avoid confusion with relocated augment's (see RELOCATION).
;;;     This is also a good time to do some other random checking. 
;;;
;;; RESOLUTION: 
;;;	    RESOLVE all name occurances, that is match each name to the 
;;;     unique subpattern or augment result to which it refers.
;;;	Any errors which arise should be reported to the user
;;;     and the remainder of the intermediate phase may be aborted.  
;;;
;;; REFERENCES:
;;;         Analyze augment REFERENCES to patterns to make sure they are valid.
;;;     This may involve generating internal augment's to handel alts, opts,
;;;     stars and sequences of length 1.  When internal augment's are
;;;     generated, it is necessary to check discrimination information.  Again,
;;;     errors are reported and the remaining code aborted. (such poetry!)
;;;
;;; CHECK REPETITIVE PATTERNS:
;;;  	    @@@ <fill in>
;;;
;;; RELOCATION:
;;;         RELOCATE the augment's to the best location for their execution
;;;     during parsing.  
;;;
;;; ALLOCATION:
;;;	    ALLOCATE slots (array positions) for each piece 
;;;     of concrete and abstract syntax which must be generated
;;;	and store the appropriate indices in the pattern or augment's.
;;;

  
;;;   Each of the above functions is given a module within the 
;;; intermediate phase.





;;; Global Variables


(defvar *error-occurred-inter?* nil)     

;;; This is a global flag utilized to avoid unnessary work after an error was
;;; found during name resolution.  It is reset in the function
;;; crunch-pattern.


(defvar *local-error-occurred-inter?* nil)

;;; This is a local flag used to halt extra checking after an error has been
;;; found locally, that is within the current pattern.  Hopefully this will
;;; avoid duplication of error messages.


(defvar *max-slot-count* 0)     

;;; During slot allocation *max-slot-count* maintains the maximum slot index
;;; allocated so far.  This value is returned to specify the space required for
;;; parsing.  It is reset in the
;;; do-slot-allocation.


(defvar *current-nt-name* nil)

;;; Name of the current nonterminal used in error reporting.

(defvar *nt-opt-default-op-count* 0)

;;; So we can generate names for null optional operators we must introduce. 

(defvar *top-level-alts* ())

;;; @Hack!  For the parser generator Roger's required the assumption that the
;;; first slot always contain the result of parsing the nonterminal.  This is
;;; different from our normal convention in the case of alternations where
;;; usually the first son is index of the branch.   To get around this, a
;;; specific bind is added to store the result of a top-level alt in the 0
;;; slot.  Unfortunately certain references must know when they are dealing
;;; with a top-level alt, so they are added to the above list.  Granted, this
;;; is an ugly fix.  But I believe the elegant way to do it is to relax Anne's
;;; restriction concerning the 0th slot, but I'm not willing to make these
;;; modifications to her code.  By the way, the reason the same problem does
;;; not come up for opt, star, and doublestar, is that none of these may occur
;;; at top level (no nullable nonterminals).

;;; Pass 1 -- Bind Augment's Module


;;; When a pattern has an associated augment, it is our convention that naming
;;; that piece of concrete syntax yields the abstract syntax built by the
;;; augment.  Since in the relocation module we will be moving augment's, we
;;; must be careful not to bind augments to each peice of concrete syntax where
;;; has one.  This is accomplished by explicitly binding the augment's to the
;;; name associated with the pattern at which they are initially defined. (That
;;; is, we are making our implicit binding conventions, explicit here rather
;;; than hiding them in later code.)  Augments are then copied and made
;;; attributes of the associated patterns -- This way we may SIDE EFFECT them
;;; without messing with the original tree.

;;; Resolution Module

;;; It is necessary to check the augment's (abstract syntax constructors) to

;;; and augment nodes) visited while going from the pattern node associated
;;; with the current augment to the definition of the name in question.  Hence
;;; with each augment which references something, the entire path is stored in
;;; the path field.  These paths are kept in reverse order to simplify

;;; Relocation Module

;;; The idea behind abstract syntax relocation is that abstract syntax can be
;;; best constructed in certain locations.  That is, it may be better
;;; constructed at lower position in the pattern tree.  Otherwise the parser
;;; would be required to grovel over large portions of the pattern and abstract
;;; syntax tree and maintain values it no longer needs. When abstract syntax is
;;; moved down, it is bound to a unique name which is then referenced from the
;;; orinial position.

;;; The reader may want to familiarize himself with the concept of a pattern
;;; path, described in the resolution module.  

;;; Please note that throughout this module, we rely on the fact that no errors
;;; were found during name resolution.

;;; The following routine simply controls the application of relocate-augment.
;;; Note that a top-down organization is necessary because as peices of
;;; abstract syntax are moved down, it may become necessary to move subpeices
;;; of that abstract syntax further down.  With a top down approach, each
;;; pattern node need only be visited once and relocated abstract syntax will
;;; be revisited.

;;; this slot allocation so that our arrays don't become unduely large.

;;; The majority of patterns and augments are assigned a single slot.
;;; Alternations, optionals, and the star patterns are exceptions; they get two
;;; slots.  Their second slot has their particular value while the first slot
;;; contains the branch index of the alternation or (t or nil) for the optional
;;; or star.  Sequence patterns which have no referenced results are not given
